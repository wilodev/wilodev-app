 * @fileOverview <FTName| pascalcase > Types
 * @description This file defines the TypeScript types and interfaces used by the <FTName| pascalcase > component.
 *              It extends and customizes standard <FTName| pascalcase > properties for enhanced type safety and clarity.
 *              This centralization of types aids in maintaining consistency and readability across the component's usage.
 *              Types are crafted to align with SOLID principles for robust and scalable code structure.
