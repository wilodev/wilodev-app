/**
 * @fileOverview Locales Index
 * @description This file serves as a central hub for exporting all locale files used in the application.
 *              It simplifies the import of locale strings throughout the app and helps maintain a clear structure.
 *              As new locale files are added for different components or screens, they should be exported here.
 *
 *              Example Import:
 *              import { loginFormLocale } from '[Relative Path]/locales';
