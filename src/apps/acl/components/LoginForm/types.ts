/**
 * @fileOverview LoginForm Types
 * @description This file defines the TypeScript types and interfaces used by the LoginForm component.
 *              It extends and customizes standard LoginForm properties for enhanced type safety and clarity.
 *              This centralization of types aids in maintaining consistency and readability across the component's usage.
 *              Types are crafted to align with SOLID principles for robust and scalable code structure.
